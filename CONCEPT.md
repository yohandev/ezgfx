- macro imports SPIR-V reflection:
    - >YayUniforms is (set = 1, binding = 0)
    - >MyTex is (set = 0, binding = 0)
    - >MySampler is (set = 0, binding = 1)
- for uniforms:
    - take typename as provided in shader
    - compile-time assert structs match, at least in size

## concept rust glsl

```rust
#[vertex]
pub struct PosTexVertex
{
    // vertex declaration is generated by the macro and can
    // be extended to support more types.
    pub [f32; 3] pos;
    pub [f32; 2] tex;
}

#[shader(vertex)]
struct MyVertShader
{
    
}

impl VertexShader for MyVertShader
{
    type Vertex = PosTexVertex;
    type Index  = u16;

    fn main()
    {

    }
